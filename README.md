This folder contains three distinct solutions developed for the [Enifit](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-energy-behavior-of-prosumers) Kaggle challenge.

Our approaches span from **LSTM networks** to **Transformer architectures**, culminating in an **ensemble model** that combines the strengths of each method.  
Our goal is to highlight the differences, strengths, and weaknesses of various architectures when tackling the same forecasting problem.

## 📖 Challenge Overview  
> *The goal of the competition is to create an energy prediction model of prosumers to reduce energy imbalance costs.*
>
> *This competition aims to tackle the issue of energy imbalance, a situation where the energy expected to be used doesn't line up with the actual energy used or produced. Prosumers, who both consume and generate energy, contribute a large part of the energy imbalance. Despite being only a small part of all consumers, their unpredictable energy use causes logistical and financial problems for the energy companies.*


## 💾 Data  
The dataset used can be downloaded directly from the [challenge page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-energy-behavior-of-prosumers/data). It consists of a CSV file that includes:  

- 🌍 Geographical information
- 🌤️ Weather data  
- 💰 Relevant energy prices  
- ☀️ Records of installed photovoltaic (PV) capacity
